# libcom
libcom is an openwrt based firmware with which you can operate a meshing node for the next generation networking and internet connectivity. With libcom you can seamlessly integrate your beam radio or network cable to your neighbor.
The network expands itself, just add more nodes and more neighbors.
The result will be a disaster proof, fast and scalable at the same time.
